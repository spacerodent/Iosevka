* The letters `k`, `x`, `v`, `A`, etc. will now use straight legs by default. The “curly” families will keep the old shape.
* Note this is a parameter difference rather than variant. So there won’t be a `cv##` or `ss##` variant selector.
* Introduced a curly italic `k` with untagged variant `v-k-italic`.
* Introduced `ss12` OpenType tag for Ubuntu-Mono style as well as a prebuilt `SS12` family.
